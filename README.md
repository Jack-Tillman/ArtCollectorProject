# Art Collector

## Description

This project was completed by both Kaleb Stephens and Jack Tillman! We worked hard over the span of a week to build this site, and we are pretty proud of what we accomplished! 

This site enables you to search the archives of the Harvard Art Museum for art based upon the century it was completed as well as the classification of the art.

Additionally, upon selecting a piece of art to look at, a detailed description and close-up image of the piece of art is displayed. Users can click on the various descriptions for Culture, Medium, Technique, Artist, and more to search for other art based on that specific criteria. 

Made with the Harvard Art Museum public API.
